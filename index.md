Hello, I am a computer science Ph.D. student in Indiana University Bloomington. And I am luckily advised by [Roni Khardon](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/rkhardon/).

I am interested in both theoretical and practical aspects of various machine learning models. Currently I am working on uncertainty quantification of deep learning.
